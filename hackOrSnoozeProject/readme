## Code Overview 
 
The app is split into the following core modules: 
 
- **models.js**: Contains Story and User classes to represent data 
- **main.js**: Contains core application logic  
- **nav.js**: Handles top navigation bar updates 
- **user.js**: Manages user account related functionality
